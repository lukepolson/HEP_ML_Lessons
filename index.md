> ## Prerequisites
> For this tutorial we will be using [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). Make sure you have [created an account](https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?phase=startRegisterTab&returnUrl=%2F).

> Please read the first three sections before coming to the tutorial:
> * [Introduction](https://lukepolson.github.io/HEP_ML_Lessons/01-introduction/index.html)
> * [Mathematical Foundations](https://lukepolson.github.io/HEP_ML_Lessons/02-mltechnical/index.html)
> * [Resources](https://lukepolson.github.io/HEP_ML_Lessons/03-Resources/index.html)

> We will briefly review these sections in the tutorial. Note that they mostly cover the mathematical foundations of machine learning; there is no coding involved in these sections.
